# Simple-Basic-CHATBOT
 Creating a simple chatbot in Python, using simple rules and the powerful nltk library to build the chatbot.
A chatbot is an artificial intelligence based tool built to converse with humans in their native language. 
These chatbots have become popular across industries, and are considered one of the most useful applications of natural language processing.
Natural Language Toolkit  is a leading python library to work with text data.
The nltk.chat module is used to import the required utilities.
Chat is a class that provides logic for building the chatbot.
Reflections, which is a dictionary that contains a set of input text and its corresponding output values. 
The first step is to create rules that will be used to train the chatbot. The lines of code below create a simple set of rules.
The first element of the list is the user input, whereas the second element is the response from the bot.
Several such lists are created in the set_pairs object.
The last step is to initiate the conversation. This is done using the code where the converse() function triggers the conversation.
